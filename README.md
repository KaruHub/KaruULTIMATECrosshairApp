Crosshair App
This is my first ever made code! It's a simple, lightweight app that displays a red crosshair in the center of your screen. You can toggle it on and off with the F3 key. The app runs in the background and works globally, so it will show up even if you're doing other tasks.

Features
Displays a red crosshair at the center of the screen.
Toggles on and off with the F3 key.
Runs in the background without interfering with other activities.
How to Use
Download the executable file from the Releases page.
Run the app.
Press F3 to toggle the crosshair on and off.
My First Project
This is my very first programming project, and Iâ€™m excited to share it with others! Feel free to check out the code and use it for your own purposes. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
